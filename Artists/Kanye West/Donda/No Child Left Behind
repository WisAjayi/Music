No Child Left Behind Lyrics[Intro: Vory]
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind

[Verse: Vory]
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God

[Chorus: Kanye West]
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miraclеs on me
He's done miraclеs on meYou might also like
